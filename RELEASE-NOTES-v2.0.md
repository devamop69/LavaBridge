# LavaBridge v2.0 Release Notes

## Overview

LavaBridge v2.0 introduces significant improvements to DDoS protection, error handling, and memory management, making the proxy more resilient under heavy load and sustained attacks.

## Major Improvements

### Enhanced DDoS Protection

- **Improved Socket Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for "write after end" and ECONNRESET errors that previously caused server crashes during prolonged attacks
- **Connection Fast Path**: Implemented a simplified connection acceptance process that reduces CPU overhead during high-volume attacks
- **Memory Optimization**: Added periodic cleanup of data structures and emergency recovery functions that activate during high load
- **TCP Socket Protection**: Improved handling of socket connections to prevent resource exhaustion

### Memory Management

- **Increased Memory Heap**: Default configuration now uses 1GB heap for better performance during attacks
- **Garbage Collection**: Added explicit garbage collection during high-load scenarios
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Implemented more efficient tracking maps with automatic cleanup

### Trust-Based Protection System

- **Enhanced Trusted User System**: Legitimate users now maintain access during attacks through behavior-based trust scoring
- **Persistent Trust**: Added disk-based persistence of trusted user data to maintain protection across server restarts
- **Adaptive Load Management**: System now dynamically adjusts connection acceptance criteria based on server load

### Configuration Updates

- **Environment-Aware Defaults**: Added automatic detection of development/production environments with appropriate security defaults
- **Optimized Runtime Flags**: Improved Node.js runtime flags for better performance
- **Advanced Performance Tuning**: Added detailed configuration options for high-traffic deployments

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed "write after end" errors occurring during socket closure
- Resolved ECONNRESET uncaught exception issues
- Fixed memory leaks in connection tracking
- Improved cleanup of expired blacklist entries
- Enhanced error logging with proper context

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes - all improvements maintain backward compatibility with v1.0

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Update your codebase to the latest version
2. No configuration changes required - existing .env files will work with improved defaults
3. Consider enabling auto-blacklisting in production environments:
   ```
   AUTO_BLACKLIST=true
   ```

## Documentation

The main README.md now contains comprehensive information about DDoS protection features and configuration options.
