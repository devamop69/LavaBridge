- [x] Basic TCP proxy server implementation
- [x] Client authentication mechanism
- [x] Protocol detection logic
- [x] Lavalink v3 connection handler
- [x] Lavalink v4 connection handler
- [x] Message proxying between client and backend servers
- [x] Error handling for connection issues
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Configuration through environment variables
- [x] Project documentation (README)
- [x] Connection tracking system
- [x] Web interface for connection monitoring
- [x] Real-time connection statistics
- [x] System health monitoring dashboard
- [x] Per-IP TCP data usage tracking
- [x] Data usage visualization
- [x] Data rate (bytes/second) tracking
- [x] Color-coded bandwidth indicators
- [x] Backend server health monitoring

## In Progress

- [ ] Testing with multiple client libraries
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Enhanced web interface features

## Planned

- [ ] Authentication for web interface
- [ ] Secure WebSocket support (WSS)
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Enhanced logging options
- [ ] Client reconnection handling
- [ ] Session resuming support
- [ ] Historical connection data tracking
- [ ] Historical bandwidth usage statistics
- [ ] Data usage alerts for unusual patterns
- [ ] Unit and integration tests

## Known Issues

1. Protocol detection might have edge cases with unusual client implementations
2. No built-in reconnection mechanism for disrupted connections
3. Web interface lacks authentication (accessible to anyone who can reach the port)
4. No historical data retention for connections and data usage
5. Data tracking might introduce slight overhead in high-volume scenarios

## Success Metrics

- Successfully routes clients to the appropriate Lavalink version
- Maintains stable connections with minimal latency overhead
- Properly handles connection errors and cleanup
- Simplifies client integration by providing a single connection endpoint
- Provides real-time monitoring through web interface
- Accurately tracks and displays TCP data usage statistics
- Monitors and visualizes real-time data transfer rates
